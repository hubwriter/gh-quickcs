# gh-quickcs

A GitHub CLI extension that lets you quickly create a new codespace for a preconfigured repository.

After installing this extension, _before you use it,_ change the value of `REPO` in [the gh-quickcs file](https://github.com/hubwriter/quickcs/blob/main/gh-doccs) to the URL `OWNER/REPO-NAME` of your repo - for example:

```
REPO="your-name/your-repo"
```

You can also change any of the other settings for the codespace in that file.

## üì¶ Installation

1. If you haven't already, install the `gh` CLI - see the [installation](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)

   _Installation requires a minimum version (2.0.0) of the the GitHub CLI that supports extensions._

1. Edit the `/Users/YOURNAME/.local/share/gh/extensions/gh-quickcs` file, changing the value of `REPO` to the owner and name that identifies the repository for which you want to create codespaces - for example: `my-name/my-repo`.
